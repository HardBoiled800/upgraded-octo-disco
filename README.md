ok, so here's what we need to do:

- read in audio input (mic or pickle)
- convert to audio signal
- make spectrogram
- make peaks
- find the cutoff for background noise
- create the "fingerprints" (THIS IS THE BIG SCARY)
- store it in a database OR
- compare it to the database (THIS IS THE SMALLER BUT STILL RELATIVELY SIZABLE SCARY)
- tie it all together
- documentation (why god why)
